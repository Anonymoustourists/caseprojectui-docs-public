# Michigan Court PDF to Markdown Conversion Specification

This document describes the rule-based conversion patterns used by the "dumb" system to convert Michigan Court of Appeals and Supreme Court PDFs to Markdown format.

## Conversion Rules

### 1. Boilerplate Removal

The following patterns are automatically removed from the PDF text:

#### Standard Headers

- `STATE OF MICHIGAN` (normal and spaced-letter variants)
- `COURT OF APPEALS` (normal and spaced-letter variants)  
- `MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT`

#### Page Elements

- Page numbers in format `-3-`, `-12-`, etc.
- Timestamps like `2:15 PM`, `10:30 AM`
- Publication disclaimers starting with "If this opinion indicates..."

#### Case Metadata Lines (removed from body)

- Lines starting with `No. 123456`
- Lines starting with `LC No. 2023-001234-CZ`
- `UNPUBLISHED` or `PUBLISHED` status lines

### 2. Heading Structure Mapping

Court outline format is converted to Markdown headings:

| Court Format | Markdown | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| `I. TITLE` | `# I. TITLE` | Main sections |
| `A. SUBTITLE` | `## A. SUBTITLE` | Subsections |
| `1. SUBPOINT` | `### 1. SUBPOINT` | Numbered points |
| `i. DETAIL` | `#### i. DETAIL` | Detailed points |

**Important**: The system preserves the original numbering tokens (I., A., 1., i.) rather than converting to generic Markdown headers.

### 3. Paragraph Reconstruction

The system reconstructs paragraphs by:

#### Line Joining Logic

- Lines ending with sentence punctuation (`.`, `!`, `?`) start new paragraphs
- **Exception**: Lines ending with legal abbreviations continue to next line
- Hyphenated words broken across lines are rejoined (`wor-\nds` â†’ `words`)

#### Legal Abbreviations (do NOT end sentences)

- `MCL.` (Michigan Compiled Laws)
- `MRE.` (Michigan Rules of Evidence)  
- `U.S.` (United States)
- `Inc.`, `Co.`, `Ltd.`, `L.L.C.`, `L.L.P.` (Corporate suffixes)
- `Ct.`, `App.` (Court abbreviations)
- `No.` (Number)
- `v.` (versus)

#### Example

```
Input PDF lines:
"The defendant violated MCL
784.234 when he committed the assault. This was
clearly established at trial."

Output Markdown:
"The defendant violated MCL 784.234 when he committed the assault. This was clearly established at trial."
```

### 4. Opinion Body Detection

The system finds where the actual opinion begins by looking for:

#### Primary Markers

- `PER CURIAM.` - Most common start of COA opinions
- Lines starting with `OPINION`

#### Fallback Markers  

- First line matching heading patterns (`I.`, `A.`, `1.`, etc.)
- Everything before these markers is considered caption/metadata

### 5. Footnote Processing

#### Detection

- Lines matching pattern: `1) footnote text` or `1. footnote text`
- Must have substantial content (more than 3 words)
- Typically found at bottom of pages

#### Output Format

Main body footnote references can optionally be converted to `[^1]` format.

Footnotes are appended as:

```markdown
---

## Footnotes

[^1]: First footnote text here
[^2]: Second footnote text here
```

### 6. Metadata Extraction

The system extracts metadata from the first page:

#### Case Name

- From banner format: `COA 123456 PLAINTIFF V DEFENDANT Opinion...`
- From caption: Looking for `ALLCAPS NAME v ALLCAPS NAME` patterns
- Normalizes `V` to `v` for readability

#### Case Numbers

- Case No.: `No. 123456` format
- Lower Court No.: `LC No. 2023-001234-CZ` format

#### Judge Panel

- Lines starting with `Before:` followed by judge names

#### Date

- Full date format: `January 15, 2025`
- Extracted from first page text

#### Publication Status

- `PUBLISHED` if contains "FOR PUBLICATION"
- `UNPUBLISHED` otherwise

#### Court Type

- Automatically set to "Michigan Court of Appeals" for COA docs
- "Michigan Supreme Court" for MSC docs

## Pattern Examples

### Input PDF Text

```
STATE OF MICHIGAN
COURT OF APPEALS

JOHN DOE,                              UNPUBLISHED
                          Plaintiff-Appellant,    January 15, 2025
v                                      No. 123456
                                       LC No. 2023-001234-CZ
JANE SMITH,
                          Defendant-Appellee.

Before: Judge A, Judge B, and Judge C.

PER CURIAM.

I. BACKGROUND

also denied by the trial court.

1. The Initial Filing

On January 1, 2023, plaintiff filed his complaint

about the case.
```

### Output Markdown

```markdown

### Metadata JSON Output

```json
{
  "case_name": "John Doe v Jane Smith",
  "case_no": "123456",
  "lc_no": "2023-001234-CZ", 
  "judges": "Judge A, Judge B, and Judge C",
  "date": "January 15, 2025",
  "publication": "UNPUBLISHED",
  "lower_court": null,
  "court": "Michigan Court of Appeals",
  "source": "pdf2md_core.py"
}
```

## Customization Guidelines

### Adding New Boilerplate Patterns

Add to `COA_BOILERPLATE_PATTERNS` list:

```python
r"^\s*YOUR_CUSTOM_HEADER\s*$",
```

### Modifying Heading Recognition

Adjust `HEADING_REPLACERS` for different outline formats:

```python
(regex.compile(r"^(SECTION\s+\d+)\.(\s+)(.+)$"), r"# \1. \3"),
```

### Adding Legal Abbreviations

Extend `ABBR_TOKENS` set:

```python
ABBR_TOKENS = {
    "MCL.", "MRE.",  # existing
    "YOURSTATE.", "CUSTOM.",  # new additions
}
```

## Quality Assurance

The system includes several quality checks:

1. **Length Validation**: Ensures output isn't dramatically shorter than input (prevents over-summarization)
2. **Structure Preservation**: Maintains original paragraph count and heading structure
3. **Content Fidelity**: Does not paraphrase or summarize - only reformats

This rule-based approach ensures consistent, predictable output without the variability of AI-based systems.
