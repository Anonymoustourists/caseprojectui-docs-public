# Definitions/Terminology

## Source

the document that has been ingested that contains the original content or source of the information. Examples include a police report, a transcript of an interview, a recording of an interview or a news article.

## Document Type

the type of document that has been ingested. Examples include police report, witness statement, witness affidavit, warrant affidavit, transcript, text message/social media, opinion/order, pleading, other.

## Media Type

the format of the source document. Examples include text (pdf, docx, txt), audio/video (examples include mp4, mp3, wav) images (examples include jpg, png, tiff).

### Source Date

The date of the source document. This is not necessarily the date of the event being described,

## Event

An event is an occurrence or happening that is described in the source. It can be a specific action, a series of actions, or a situation that is being reported. Events are often tied to the speaker and declarant, as they provide context for the statements being made.

### Event Date

The date when the event occurred. This is not necessarily the date of the source document, but rather the date of the event being described. When the event is directly recorded / displayed in the source, such as in a transcript where a verdict is read out loud, the event is the verdict, and the source is the transcript, and the event date is the same as the source date. In other cases, such as a police report describing an incident that happened on a different day than the report was written.

## Person

A person is an individual who is involved in the event or proceeding --- either someone involved in the facts underlying the case, or someone involved in the legal process itself. This includes anyone who is named
or mentioned in the source. This can include witnesses, victims, suspects, law enforcement officers, or any other individuals relevant to the event being described.

## Speaker

The person who makes the statement in the source. If a police report is the source, and is signed by by Officer X, Officer X is the speaker, even if the report says that the officer was told by Witness Y that she saw.

## Declarant

The person who made the original statement. If the source is a police report, and Officer X is the speaker, but Officer X is reporting what Witness Y told her, then Witness Y is the declarant. In sources directly recording what someone is saying, such as a transcript of an interview, the speaker and declarant are the same person.
