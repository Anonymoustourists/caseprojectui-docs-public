# 📘 Project Index — Case Project Rebuild

**Location:** `/Documentation/Index.md`  
**Last updated:** October 2025

This file is the single source of truth for the rebuild. Track every PR here and keep it current.

---

## How to use this file

- When you **start** a PR: add it under **In Progress / Incomplete PRs** and put it in the right **Work Category** below.
- Each PR should have a triplet in `/Documentation/PRs/`:
  - `pr<N>.md` (design/spec)
  - `pr<N>-manifest.json` (machine-readable change list)
  - `runlog-PR<N>.md` (evidence: lint/test/build output + manual check)
- When you **finish** a PR: move it to **Completed PRs**.
- **Tiny fixes** (typos, path updates, doc corrections) may be logged under `/Documentation/PATCHES/` instead of a PR. See PATCHES/README.md for workflow.

Legend:

- `[ ]` not done / planned `[x]` complete `⚙️` in progress `🔜` planned

## PR workflow checklist

1. Add PR to **In Progress** and **Work Category**.
2. Create `PRs/pr<N>.md`, `PRs/pr<N>-manifest.json`, `PRs/runlog-PR<N>.md`.
3. Implement; keep manifest updated (`added/modified/deleted`, tests, scripts).
4. Verify: `npm run lint` · `npm run test` · `npm run build` · manual smoke.
5. Paste the last lines of test/build output into the runlog.
6. Move PR to **Completed PRs** and commit.

---

## Gating policy and commands

Thresholds for ingest/eval PRs must satisfy:

- Null adapters = 0
- Unknown page-types ≤ 15%
- QA rate drop vs prior ≤ 10%

Make targets:

- `make merge` — merge batches and run offline eval
- `make reeval` — retag + eval
- `make gate` — enforce thresholds and print histogram
- `make verify` — lint, unit, e2e
- `make sample` — print 10 deterministic doc paths for spot-check

LLM review runs only if thresholds are tripped; never part of gate.

```text

want me to wire in live links (e.g., `[PR 5](PRs/pr5.md)` and `[runlog](PRs/runlog-PR5.md)`) for every item now, or keep it minimal until you migrate the files into `/Documentation/PRs/`?
```
